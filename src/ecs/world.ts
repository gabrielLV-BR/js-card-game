/*
    This is my first ECS implementation
    Although I'm proud of it, it objectively sucks
    
    ECS is a design architecture that separates a
        program/game's parts into their most basic
        forms: data and logic

    Components are data
    Systems are logic
    Entities link components

    It's useful to see an ECS as a sort of database

    In this configuration, we could have:
        - A Physics System, which only cares about the Physics Component
        - A Controller System, which cares about the Controller and
            Physics Component

    Player and Enemy share the same Physics System because they both have
        the Physics Component. Every Entity that has that Component will
        have its Component processed as well

    Only Player has the Controller Component and, therefore, only the player
        will be affected. If we put a Controller Component on the Enemy, then
        he would be affected as well

    And this is why ECS is awesome
